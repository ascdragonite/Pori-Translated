- Without the water that flows from these pools, the land would wither, and that mill you restarted would sit silent once more.
- Places like these, it’s important to protect. And to map!

lumaPoolsLupoFlavorBTextMessageProvider: 2 4
- You know what I heard?
- When the Willow died and its light spread across the land, the brightest bit of light landed right here, in Luma Pools!

gorlekMinesLupoFlavorATextMessageProvider: 1 4
- You’ve met the Gorlek miners, have you?
- A fascinating lot, to be sure. Their dedication to mining is rivaled only by my dedication to map-making!
- They weren’t always miners, you know. They used to be builders, and what builders they were!
- If the Windswept Wastes ever grow less...windswept, perhaps they can go back to their work above-ground someday.

gorlekMinesLupoFlavorBTextMessageProvider: 1 4
- The Gorlek are as good at digging down as they are at building up, if you ask me.
- Though digging is not without its risks. Some miners stay in the depths so long they change.
- It’s a sad tale, to be sure. Makes mapping a bit dicey, too, what with those unruly sorts swinging picks at me!
- I heard the master miner, Grol, went out digging for a cure a while back. I’ll have to ask him about it next time I see him.

- Much nicer! Funny how a bit of decoration here and there makes everything feel better, eh?

hubBeautificationDescriptionTextMessageProvider:
- The Moki are right...building is only half the work. Nothing's quite complete without some finishing touches of decoration.

hubBeautificationNameTextMessageProvider:
- The Gorlek Touch

hubCaveEntranceCompleteTextMessageProvider:
- That cave's safe and ready to explore! Well, the entrance's safe, at least. Be careful down there.

hubCaveEntranceDescriptionTextMessageProvider: 1
- That old cave entrance looks like it's about to collapse...but we Gorlek learned a thing or two about tunnelling after fleeing to the mines. With some Ore, I can repair it.

hubCaveEntranceNameTextMessageProvider:
- Clear the Cave Entrance

hubHousesCompleteTextMessageProvider:
- The Moki homes are complete! And they won't be needing repairs anytime soon, now that they're Gorlek made.

hubHousesDescriptionTextMessageProvider: 1

hubSpiritWellCompleteTextMessageProvider: 1
- Before our home was swallowed by sand, the spirits saw potential in Gorlek Ore.
- They disappeared before they could try what we built them. But now you’re back, and that can change.

- I will stay here and keep watch. Bravely.

braveMokiFirstEncounterTextMessageProvider: a
- Are you a spirit? Then tremble, spirit! You stand before Mokk the Brave!
- It is not very convincing, I know. But I am brave. Or I would be, with a trophy!
- A trophy like...like a Howl skull! Or just a fang, if that's too heavy.
- I heard the Howler fighting to the east. Maybe it dropped one?

braveMokiFoundItemRetalkTextMessageProvider: 1
- Silence, spirit! I am rehearsing the epic tale of my fight with Howl!

baursReachTokkSeesShriekRetalkBTextMessageProvider: 1
- I traveled here to see the Spring Blossom tree, but I doubt anything's survived on that icy peak.

- I wouldn't be here at all if I hadn't lost that compass the last time I passed through.
- Think you could help me find it? I believe it was somewhere through that door over there...

lostCompassTokkRetalkTextMessageProvider: 1 2
- Now to see what wonders of the old world I can find before the Decay swallows the rest of what's left.
- Maybe the ancient temple buried under the sands of the Windswept Wastes? Or even the depths of the Midnight Burrows?
- So much wandering to do. So little time.

- All gone to dust and ruins, now. While the great Gorlek cower beneath the sands. Bah!
- Truth be told, I came out here hoping to find something worth scavenging. What I found was sand. A lot of sand.
- You seem the digging type. Maybe you'll have better luck?

hubTokkAfterBaursReachTextMessageProvider: 1 3
- No sooner do I wander back to these parts when I hear about what happened out in the Reach. Squork!
- Sounds like I'll have to stretch these legs again and take a look for myself.
- Truth is, when I saw all that ice out there, I'd written off ever seeing the Spring Blossom tree again, or the green hills of the Reach.
- Now it sounds like spring is here again, and you're to thank. Not bad for someone without feathers.

hubTokkAfterGoldenSeinTextMessageProvider: 1 3
- Squork! You've really done it this time!
- The light coming together, that has to be good, surely. But the ground shaking, and those lights on the horizon...
- And Shriek's been spotted up on the Weeping Ridge! It's enough to make this wanderer want to find a nest and stay put.

hubTokkAfterKuStompTextMessageProvider: 3
- I heard what happened to your friend, and I am sorry. Sorry for your friend, and for the one that hurt her.
- Nothing's fouler than when the strong hurt the weak.
- But the light, coming back together...now that's promising.
- We need something to lift the gloom, and the dust, and the sand. Maybe you're the one to make that happen, hnn?

hubTokkAfterLumaPoolsTextMessageProvider: 1 3 4
- Squork...
- I've said before that this land has fallen far... but this is the first time I've really felt it.
- Kwolok was more than just the Guardian of Inkwater Marsh. He gave us hope that we could stop the Decay, or at least, slow it.
- Now...that hope's with you, and the wisps. Good luck, spirit.

hubTokkAfterMouldwoodTextMessageProvider: 1 2
- Things are changing in Niwen, spirit, and I'm not sure I approve. Bah!
- That is what you are, hnn, a spirit? What else could have returned the light to Mouldwood?
- It's not all good news, mind you. Now there's little spiders everywhere, and they're always getting underfoot.
- I know better than to step on them, of course. Considering who their mother is.

hubTokkAfterWatermillTextMessageProvider: 1 4
- Now this is more like it! Might be time to take up fishing again with all this clean water flowing through the Glades.
- I gather you're to thank for this turn of events. Let me know when you figure out how to fix the rest, hnn?
- It's hard to wander when there's ash all about, like in that dead forest to the east. Bah!
- And when the shrieking shadow flies overhead, the smart bird stays indoors.

hubTokkFirstEncounterTextMessageProvider: 1 3
- Squork! Fancy meeting you here.
- This place isn't half bad for building a nest. Not that I've got any plans to settle down.
- I hear that old Gorlek Grom aims to make these Glades even better. He should start by cleaning the water. Bah!

inkwaterMarshTokkFirstEncounterHasItemTextMessageProvider: 1 2 3 4 5
- Squork! What are you, now? Not a Moki, clearly.
- Not even from Niwen, are you. I've visited most lands near and far and not seen your kind. Come from across the water, maybe?

- I'm taking shelter from that storm, myself, but if you're thinking of going further, you'll have to get through that Spirit Gate to the east.
- Can't say I favor your odds, but if you're dead set on it, well, I have the other keystone you need right here.

- Well, whatever you are, I'm Tokk, a wanderer in these parts. The better parts, at least.
- I'm taking shelter from that storm, myself, but if you're thinking of going further, you'll have to get through that Spirit Gate over there.
- You'll need two keystones. I happen to have one in my bag, and there's another in the cave to the west.

- The great Kwolok is no mere legend. No, he's quite real.
- When the light left the Spirit Willow and Decay spread through the land, he was watching.
- If it weren't for him, the Moki might not have had a place to go when the woods where they used to live grew too dangerous.
- That's why they call Kwolok their guardian. He's kept the Decay at bay...for now.

gromDesertRumorTextMessageProvider: 2 3

- Our spires rose higher than the hills before the wind and sand brought them crumbling down.
- If you go there, take care. It is a hard place.

- You made quick work of the wall, there. Guess my building skills aren't what they used to be.
- Still, I made a promise I would provide refuge from the Decay here. These Glades are counting on me, spirit.
- But without Ore, I fear I will let them all down. The materials I need were abandoned when my kind fled to the mines.
- And without the proper supplies, well, my dream of a haven might end before it has even begun.

wellspringGladesGromFirstOreReactionTextMessageProvider: a

- Lucky for you I’ve been watching your every move. Just to make sure you’re alright, of course.

motayMourningRetalkTextMessageProvider: 1 4 5
- I used to watch Shriek...before I knew what she would become.
- I watched the forest wrong her, and I said nothing. And then I watched her take revenge, Ori.
- First she marred trees, and I watched. Then she destroyed nests, and I watched. I just watched!
- Then she found a Moki village... If only I had your courage! But I did not leave my hiding place.
- I wonder sometimes...could I have stopped it all? But no, I’m just Motay. I hide, and I watch.

motayMourningTextMessageProvider: 1
- I saw what Shriek did to your friend, Ori. I’m truly sorry.
- I think...Ku reminded her of something. Something she hates.
- She was little too, once. Vulnerable. She doesn’t want to remember that, Ori.
- But there is something she didn’t see. Ku is strong. I know. I was watching.

motayOfferTextMessageProvider:

motayRetalkTextMessageProvider: 2 3 4

- There’s only one I don't watch. I just run from her. And you should too.

motaySilentWoodsShrineRumorPostSilentWoodsTextMessageProvider: 1

- Err...Just me and no one else. I hope.

motaySilentWoodsShrineRumorTextMessageProvider: 1 3 4

- There’s others there even better than me at hiding. They take all the best spots.
- But I know one spot they don't! A great spot for hiding. Once a shrine to the ancient spirits, they say.
- Still, it’s her domain, through and through. I've watched many enter and never return.
- ...I can’t talk you down from going, can I.

motayTradeHintBeltBagTextMessageProvider: a
- I can’t wait to see what wonders Tokk will find with that treasure map you gave him!
- Must have been some map, for him to have given you his favorite bag in exchange.

motayTradeHintCanteenTextMessageProvider: 1 2
- You don’t need the canteen I gave you?
- That’s lucky! I heard some cries for water while passing through the desert.
- Most of us can only survive for a couple days without water, you know. Hope you’re not too late!

motayTradeHintHatTextMessageProvider: 1 3
- That Moki was smart to get rid of a hat like that. It’s so...distinct. Why stand out when you can blend in?
- Everyone knows leaves make the best hats. Stylish and inconspicuous.
- Yes yes, a hat like that is better for shade than a leaf. But I prefer to stick to the shadows anyway.

motayTradeHintHerbsTextMessageProvider: 2 3 4
- Just imagine the adventures that Moki will go on with an adventurer’s pack!
- She seems to have a knack for it, judging by those rare herbs she gave you.
- They don't just grow anywhere, you know. That’s why spicy marshclam soup is such a delicacy 'round here.
- But it takes a real chef to get it just right, take it from me. I’ve burned my tongue enough times to know!

motayTradeHintLanternTextMessageProvider: 1 2 3
- A Gorlek lantern! They’re special, you know. Very hard to break.
- If I had one, I could watch Niwen at night, too! Not even the dark down in Mouldwood Depths could stop me.
- Shame there’s no light inside. Maybe someone has some fireflies you could use!
- I’ll keep an eye out. As always.

motayTradeHintMapstoneTabletTextMessageProvider: 1 2 3
- You made it just in time! What a relief. That Gorlek looked parched!
- That tablet he gave you... I’ve watched many explorers try and fail to find one like it.
- They say it’s a fragment of the great Map Stone, leading to untold treasures buried beneath desert sands.
- But treasure is usually shiny. Not helpful for blending in at all, if you ask me.

motayTradeHintSilkStringTextMessageProvider: 1 2
- It wasn’t easy, following you to Mouldwood Depths. All the best hiding spots are full of sticky spiderwebs.

motayTradeHintSnackTextMessageProvider: 1 3

motayTradeSequenceGetItemTextMessageProvider: 1 3

mokiLagoonRumorRetalkTextMessageProvider: 1

tuleyIntroWellspringTextMessageProvider: 1
- I’ve seen many a novelty since I fled my frozen garden after the storms. But a spirit...
- My family told me stories. That your kind once roamed these lands where they call me stranger.
- I’m not complaining, mind you. I’d almost forgotten the feeling of soft soil at my fingertips.
- But it does not yet feel like home.

tuleyIntroWellspringWithSeedRetalkTextMessageProvider: 2 3
- My kind, we aren’t adventurers. If it weren’t for the frost, I’d never have left my old hut.
- I’d never have seen the Wellspring, or Kwolok’s Hollow. And the seeds I found there!
- Who knows how many more lay scattered, waiting to be planted in these quiet Glades.

tuleyIntroWellspringWithSeedTextMessageProvider: 1
- A Spring Plant seed! I thought I saved them all from that icy wasteland I once called home...
- But I must have dropped one while fleeing the frost. Thank you, spirit, for saving it.

- It seems the stories were true. Welcome back, spirit. May we both once again feel at home.

- Now the Glades shelter a new garden for all, and I...I finally feel at home. Thank you, spirit.

tuleyGotBranchTextMessageProvider:
- This branch...you must take it far away from here.
- Can’t you see? It’s more stone than wood. The tree it belonged to is beyond hope.

- She helped me get by, after Shriek... well, after I was left on my own.
- I think it would make her proud, seeing how popular my soup is amongst the Moki in these Glades!

iceFisherFirstEncounterTextMessageProvider: 1 3
- Ah! And you must be Ori. Welcome, welcome. What an honor...a spirit in my own kitchen!
- Oh dear, I apologize for the chill. Please, help yourself to a warm spot by the fire!
- Me? I’m used to the cold. The Decay froze over my old home in Baur’s Reach a long time ago.
- Besides, these frozen waters are home to the tastiest fish... Once you can get beneath the ice, that is!
- Every visitor can count on some warmth and a full belly. That’s the least I can do, in these dark times.

iceFisherGetItemTextMessageProvider:
- You...brought me spicy herbs? Where did you find them?
