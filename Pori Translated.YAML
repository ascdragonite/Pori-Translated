gorlekMinesLupoFlavorATextMessageProvider:
You’ve met the #Gorlek# miners, have you?
A fascinating lot, to be sure. Their dedication to mining\nis rivaled only by my dedication to map-making!
They weren’t always miners, you know.\nThey used to be builders, and what builders they were!
If the #Windswept Wastes# ever grow less...windswept,\nperhaps they can go back to their work above-ground someday.

gorlekMinesLupoFlavorBTextMessageProvider:
The #Gorlek# are as good at digging down\nas they are at building up, if you ask me.
Though digging is not without its risks.\nSome miners stay in the depths so long they #change#.
It’s a sad tale, to be sure. Makes mapping a bit dicey, too,\nwhat with those unruly sorts swinging picks at me!
I heard the master miner, #Grol#, went out digging for a cure\na while back. I’ll have to ask him about it next time I see him.

gorlekMinesLupoInsufficientFundsTextMessageProvider:

Much nicer! Funny how a bit of #decoration# here\nand there makes everything feel better, eh?

The Moki homes are complete! And they won't be\nneeding repairs anytime soon, now that they're #Gorlek# made.

Don't mind me. I'm just here, enjoying\nthe view, freezing my tail feathers off.

You see that? She's almost majestic...\nwhen viewed from a safe distance.
#Shriek# began hunting these heights when the wind turned cold.
I'm a bit of a wanderer, myself, but I don't imagine\n#curiosity# spurred that bird to roam the #Reach#.
Maybe these frozen wastes are just nicer\nthan what she's leaving behind? #Brrr#!

It is my compass! I'm in your debt, fellow wanderer.
Here, take this. Debt paid!

lostCompassTokkFirstEncounterRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Still haven't found that #compass#?\nDon't worry, I'll be around.

lostCompassTokkFirstEncounterTextMessageProvider:
This #Wellspring#'s no place for wandering.\nThese wheels have got my insides turned all about.
I wouldn't be here at all if I hadn't lost that\n#compass# the last time I passed through.
Think you could help me find it? I believe it\nwas somewhere through that #door# over there...

lostCompassTokkRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Now to see what wonders of the old world I can find before\nthe #Decay# swallows the rest of what's left.
Maybe the ancient temple buried under the\nsands of the #Windswept Wastes#? Or even\nthe depths of the #Midnight Burrows#?
So much wandering to do. So little time.

You found anything yet?

desertTokkFirstEncounterTextMessageProvider:
This is the place! Here's where the #Gorlek# of old\nbuilt their wonders. Towering spires! Swooping arches!
All gone to dust and ruins, now. While the\ngreat #Gorlek# cower beneath the sands. Bah!
Truth be told, I came out here hoping to find #something#\nworth scavenging. What I found was sand. A lot of sand.

No sooner do I wander back to these parts when\nI hear about what happened out in the Reach. #Squork#!

Truth is, when I saw all that ice out there,\nI'd written off ever seeing the #Spring Blossom#\ntree again, or the green hills of the #Reach#.
Now it sounds like spring is here again, and you're to thank.\nNot bad for someone without feathers.

hubTokkAfterGoldenSeinTextMessageProvider:
#Squork#! You've really done it this time!
The light coming together, that has to be good, surely.\nBut the ground shaking, and those lights on the horizon...
And #Shriek#'s been spotted up on the #Weeping Ridge#!\nIt's enough to make this wanderer want to find a nest and stay put.

hubTokkAfterKuStompTextMessageProvider:
I heard what happened to your friend, and I am sorry.\nSorry for your friend, and for the one that hurt her.
Nothing's fouler than when the strong hurt the weak.

We need something to lift the gloom, and the dust,\nand the sand. Maybe you're the one to make that happen, hnn?

hubTokkAfterLumaPoolsTextMessageProvider:
#Squork#...
I've said before that this land has fallen far...\nbut this is the first time I've really felt it.
#Kwolok# was more than just the #Guardian# of #Inkwater Marsh#.\nHe gave us hope that we could stop the #Decay#, or at least, slow it.
Now...that hope's with you, and the #wisps#.\nGood luck, spirit.

hubTokkAfterMouldwoodTextMessageProvider:
Things are changing in #Niwen#, spirit,\nand I'm not sure I approve. Bah!
That is what you are, hnn, a #spirit#? What else\ncould have returned the light to Mouldwood?
It's not all good news, mind you. Now there's little\nspiders everywhere, and they're always getting underfoot.
I know better than to step on them, of course.\nConsidering who their mother is.

hubTokkAfterWatermillTextMessageProvider:
Now this is more like it! Might be time to take up fishing\nagain with all this clean water flowing through the #Glades#.
I gather you're to thank for this turn of events.\nLet me know when you figure out how to fix the rest, hnn?
It's hard to wander when there's ash all about,\nlike in that dead forest to the east. Bah!
And when the #shrieking# shadow flies overhead,\nthe smart bird stays indoors.

hubTokkFirstEncounterTextMessageProvider:
#Squork!# Fancy meeting you here.
This place isn't half bad for building a nest.\nNot that I've got any plans to settle down.
I hear that old Gorlek #Grom# aims to make these\n#Glades# even better. He should start by cleaning the water. Bah!

inkwaterMarshTokkFirstEncounterHasItemTextMessageProvider:

Well, whatever you are, I'm #Tokk#, a wanderer\nin these parts. The better parts, at least.
I'm taking shelter from that storm, myself,\nbut if you're thinking of going further, you'll have\nto get through that #Spirit Gate# to the #east#.
Can't say I favor your odds, but if you're dead set on it,\nwell, I have the other #keystone# you need right here.
Here, it's yours. Consider it a token\nof support for a fellow wanderer.

And you can carry on with, er,\nwhatever it is you're doing. Good luck.

kwoloksHollowTokkEntranceHintRetalkTextMessageProvider:
The great #Kwolok# is no mere legend.\nNo, he's quite real.
When the light left the #Spirit Willow# and\n#Decay# spread through the land, he was watching.
If it weren't for him, the #Moki# might not\nhave had a place to go when the woods where\nthey used to live grew too dangerous.
That's why they call #Kwolok# their guardian.\nHe's kept the #Decay# at bay...for now.

kwoloksHollowTokkEntranceHintTextMessageProvider:
The gaze of the great #Kwolok# admits only the worthy...
Or so the legend says. Of course, this\n#isn't# Kwolok. It's just a statue, hnn?
Come to think of it, it doesn't have any eyes, either.\nHow's it supposed to #gaze# at anything?
Some legend. Bah!

The fish are biting...and not just the bait.\nRisked life and wing to catch one!
Shame we can’t all be like those underwater flowers, hnn?\nThey retract at the slightest touch…or nibble.
If only my tail feathers could do that,\nfishing would be a lot less painful. Bah!

tokkLumaPoolsWaterLoweredRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Still, I'm glad the Moki are around after the #Decay#.\nThriving, even, thanks to #Kwolok#.
I just wish they wouldn't thrive in my fishing hole. Bah!

tokkLumaPoolsWaterLoweredTextMessageProvider:
As if fishing wasn’t hard enough, what with\nthe #Moki# taking up all the best spots.
Now all the water’s been drained from my little pool too.\nYou didn’t happen to see which one did it, did you?
There’s only that #well# left, and it doesn’t even\nhave water in it! How am I supposed to fish now, hnn?

To the casual observer they might look\nlike a pile of rocks, but to me, they're a #key#!

But without #Ore#, I fear I will let them all down.\nThe materials I need were abandoned when my kind fled to the mines.
And without the proper supplies, well, my dream\nof a haven might end before it has even begun.

wellspringGladesGromFirstOreReactionTextMessageProvider:
I can hardly believe it. I haven’t laid eyes upon\nreal #Gorlek Ore# since we left our homeland.\nThank you, spirit.
\nTo build again with such materials...well,\nI can call myself a true #Gorlek# once more.
I'll keep my promise. The #Glades# will be a haven\nfor all, far from the #Decay# and the shadow in the sky.

wellspringGladesGromGorlekWarningNoTextMessageProvider:
Eh, dreams take patience, I suppose.\nBut soon I'll be building again, like a true #Gorlek#.
Few true Gorlek are left, so be wary if you see anyone out there\nwho looks like me. Not all of us escaped the corruption in time.

wellspringGladesGromGorlekWarningYesTextMessageProvider:
I'll get right on that! Now that I'm building again,\nI can call myself a true #Gorlek# once more.
Few true Gorlek are left, so be wary if you see anyone out there\nwho looks like me. Not all of us escaped the corruption in time.

wellspringGladesGromGotSeinTextMessageProvider:
The forest is alive with news that the light is #whole# again.
It warms my heart, knowing the ruins\nof my home fulfilled their purpose.
Now go, spirit! Too long has the #Willow# waited for the light’s return.

wellspringGladesGromIntroATextMessageProvider:
Hey! Who tore down my #wall#?

wellspringGladesGromIntroBTextMessageProvider:
Come on over. Let's get a closer look at you.

wellspringGladesGromKwolokDeathTextMessageProvider:
You know, spirit, for a moment there I really\nthought things were taking a turn for the better.
For some, hope left #Niwen# along with the spirits of old.\n#Kwolok#...he held on, and saved so many.
I will do my best to carry on his work,\nbut it feels lonelier now. I will miss him.

wellspringGladesGromPoolsDiscoveredTextMessageProvider:
They say you’ve made it all the way to paradise!
It used to have fewer thorns, sure,\nbut #Luma Pools# survived the worst of the #Decay#.
What I wouldn’t give for a visit! But there’s work\nto be done here. A builder never rests, eh?

wellspringGladesGromWastesDiscoveredTextMessageProvider:
The Moki say you've been to my homeland, or what's left of it.
The #Windswept Wastes#, they call it, eh? I suppose they've\nforgotten its true name, if they ever knew it in the first place.
#Gerora#, it was called. A wondrous city of proud stone\nand painted glass, colossal arches and lofty spires.
It deserves to be remembered.

wellspringGladesGromWellCompleteTextMessageProvider:
The #Well#'s all set up, thanks to your help!\nNow that I'm building again, I can call\nmyself a true #Gorlek# once more.
The spirits used wells to traverse all #Niwen#. They even\nvisited my homeland, before the sandstorms levelled it.

hubMokiCAfterTextMessageProvider:
The #Glades# are getting prettier!
It is thanks to #Grom#.
He is better at building.\nWe are better at playing.

hubMokiCBeforeTextMessageProvider:
More Moki come to the #Glades# every day.
That is why we ask #Grom# to help\nmake the #Glades# pretty.
We would do it ourselves, but we\nare small, and we would rather play.

hubMokiDialogATextMessageProvider:
You must be the #spirit# they talk about.\nWelcome to the #Wellspring Glades#!
It is nice here. #Grom# the Gorlek\nbuilds us new homes.
And #Veral# makes us #marshclam soup#.\nSo spicy. So delicious!

hubMokiDialogBTextMessageProvider:
The water is clean!\nThere are caves to explore!
I cannot jump high like you,\nbut I am very enthusiastic.
Enthusiasm makes everything an adventure.

hubMokiDialogDTextMessageProvider:
Halt! None may pass the great lookout!\nThat is me.
I stand watch for #Shriek# the hunter. She wants to eat Moki.\nAnd our marshclam soup. It is delicious.
You may pass, spirit.

mokiFatherBuiltHutRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Yes, this is a good hut. A good home.\nMy family will be happy here.
I cannot wait to see my pup\nonce more. O, celebration!

mokiFatherBuiltHutTextMessageProvider:
#Grom# has built a good hut,\nand a good hut makes a good home.
If you go #east#, could you tell my\nfamily I have found a new home?
They live in the #Silent Woods#,\nin the #first hut#, near the #entrance#.
I will pay for the help!\nAnd here, you might need this #key#.
The woods are not safe. Not anymore.

mokiFatherFirstEncounterRetalkTextMessageProvider:
The #Silent Woods# are no longer safe.\nBad things...dark wings.
That is why I came here.\nTo find a better place.
Do you think the Gorlek #Grom# will build a home for us?

mokiFatherFirstEncounterTextMessageProvider:
I came far to find these #Glades#.\nIt is paradise here for #Moki#.
My family will like it here.\nBut we have no home.
The Gorlek #Grom# knows the building ways.\nMaybe he can help?

mokiFatherFoundFamilyTextMessageProvider:
Spirit! Have you found my family in the #Silent Woods#?
That is...my #pup's doll#!\nBut it is #stone#! No...
I...I must go home.

mokiFatherHutAlreadyBuiltTextMessageProvider:
These #Glades# are paradise for #Moki#,\nand there is a good home here.
I must tell my family.\nThey are still in the #Silent Woods#.
Could you tell them for me?\nI will pay for the help.
They live in the #first hut#, near the #entrance#\nto the #Woods#. You might need this key.
The woods are not safe. Not anymore.

I can hardly believe it...\nI’m talking to a real #spirit#, in #Niwen#!
You're smaller than I thought,\nup close. Oh, but so bright!
I myself prefer to blend in.\nIt’s not safe out there, you know.
Lucky for you I’ve been watching your every move.\nJust to make sure you’re alright, of course.

motayMourningRetalkTextMessageProvider:
I used to watch #Shriek#...before\nI knew what she would become.
I watched the forest wrong her, and I said nothing.\nAnd then I watched her take revenge, Ori.
First she marred trees, and I watched.\nThen she destroyed nests, and I watched. I just watched!
Then she found a #Moki# village... If only I had your courage!\nBut I did not leave my hiding place.
I wonder sometimes...could I have stopped it all?\nBut no, I’m just #Motay#. I hide, and I watch.

motayMourningTextMessageProvider:
I saw what #Shriek# did to your\nfriend, Ori. I’m truly sorry.
I think...#Ku# reminded her of something.\nSomething she hates.
She was little too, once. Vulnerable.\nShe doesn’t want to remember that, Ori.
But there is something she didn’t see.\n#Ku# is strong. I know. I was watching.

motayOfferNoTextMessageProvider:
[Exit] No

motayOfferTextMessageProvider:
Care to see my records of you?

motayOfferYesTextMessageProvider:
[DialogueOption1] Yes

motayRetalkTextMessageProvider:
You’re new here, so of course I’m watching you!
#Niwen# has been waiting a long time for your kind to return.
But I watch the #Moki# too, and #Grom#, and...oh!\n#Grom# sings to himself when he thinks no one’s listening.
There’s only one I don't watch.\nI just run from #her#. And you should too.

motaySilentWoodsShrineRumorPostSilentWoodsTextMessageProvider:
The #Silent Woods# is a place of...bad memories. I know.
But there’s a place of interest there too!\nA shrine to the ancient spirits.
If you return there, just know that you won’t be alone!\nI’ll be with you every step of the way.
Err...Just me and no one else. I hope.

motaySilentWoodsShrineRumorTextMessageProvider:
The further you go #east#, the harder it is for\nme to follow! 'Specially in the #Silent Woods#.
There’s others there even better than me\nat hiding. They take all the best spots.
But I know one spot they don't! A great spot\nfor hiding. Once a #shrine# to the ancient spirits, they say.
Still, it’s #her# domain, through and through.\nI've watched many enter and never return.
...I can’t talk you down from going, can I.

motayTradeHintBeltBagTextMessageProvider:
I can’t wait to see what wonders Tokk will find\nwith that #treasure map# you gave him!
Must have been some map, for him to\nhave given you his favorite #bag# in exchange.
Always wondered why he liked that little #bag# so much.\nThe straps would fit a #Moki# much better.

motayTradeHintCanteenTextMessageProvider:
You don’t need the #canteen# I gave you?
That’s lucky! I heard some cries for water\nwhile passing through the #desert#.
Most of us can only survive for a couple days\nwithout water, you know. Hope you’re not too late!

motayTradeHintHatTextMessageProvider:
That Moki was smart to get rid of a #hat# like that.\nIt’s so...distinct. Why stand out when you can blend in?
Everyone knows leaves make the best hats.\nStylish and inconspicuous.
Yes yes, a hat like that is better for #shade# than a leaf.\nBut I prefer to stick to the shadows anyway.

motayTradeHintHerbsTextMessageProvider:
Just imagine the adventures that Moki\nwill go on with an adventurer’s pack!
She seems to have a knack for it,\njudging by those #rare herbs# she gave you.
They don't just grow anywhere, you know.\nThat’s why #spicy marshclam soup# is such a delicacy 'round here.
But it takes a #real chef# to get it just right, take it from me.\nI’ve burned my tongue enough times to know!

motayTradeHintLanternTextMessageProvider:
A #Gorlek lantern#! They’re special,\nyou know. Very hard to break.
If I had one, I could watch #Niwen# at night, too!\nNot even the dark down in #Mouldwood Depths# could stop me.
Shame there’s no light inside. Maybe someone\nhas some #fireflies# you could use!
I’ll keep an eye out. As always.

motayTradeHintMapstoneTabletTextMessageProvider:
You made it just in time! What a relief.\nThat #Gorlek# looked parched!
That #tablet# he gave you... I’ve watched\nmany explorers try and fail to find one like it.
They say it’s a fragment of the great #Map Stone#,\nleading to untold treasures buried beneath desert sands.
But treasure is usually shiny. Not helpful\nfor blending in at all, if you ask me.

motayTradeHintSilkStringTextMessageProvider:
It wasn’t easy, following you to #Mouldwood Depths#.\nAll the best hiding spots are full of sticky spiderwebs.
At least you got some #silk string# as a memento.\n16 branches long, too!
That's enough string to make a fishing net, you know.

motayTradeHintSnackTextMessageProvider:
Oh my oh my, that #marshclam soup# smells\neven more delicious than it looks!
Mother always made it for me when I had a cold.\nNothing like some spicy soup to get you all warmed up!
You know, I did hear some loud sneezing in #Baur’s Reach#.\nHurry! Sneezes and snow don’t mix.

motayTradeSequenceGetItemTextMessageProvider:
Look at that! Is that a #spyglass#?\nI could really use one of those!
Then I wouldn't have to follow you so\nclosely! Not that I follow you. Everywhere.
Here, have this #canteen#. It's filled\nwith delicious water! That's two for one!

mouldwoodMokiFirstEncounterPostMoraTextMessageProvider:
You are glowing! Are you a #spirit#?
I tried to catch some fireflies,\nbut they keep getting away.
Maybe if I had #something# to put them in?

mouldwoodMokiFoundItemRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Now which way was I going?\nThis way? No...

mouldwoodMokiFoundItemTextMessageProvider:
Hello there, spirit!\nIs that an empty #lantern# you have?
I can use that to trap these\nfireflies! I can go home!
Here, you may have this. Getting it\nwas very tricky. And sticky.

mouldwoodMokiHubTextMessageProvider:
Hello! Thank you for the #lantern#, spirit.\nI caught many fireflies!
Now I go to the #Mouldwood Depths#\nwhenever I want to get more silk.
And the spiders help me!\nIt is a good time to be a Moki.

racerMokiAfterTradeTextMessageProvider:
You are wondering why I do not leave\nmy cave with my nice and shady hat.
I am working up the courage, that is all.

racerMokiRacePlaceholderTextMessageProvider:
Oh, hello.
I came here from the #Marsh# because\nI heard the #Glades# were beautiful.
They are beautiful. But the light here is\nso bright. Not like the gloomy marsh.
That is why I am hiding in the shade.
If I had a #hat# like that funny one over there...
But I do not.

racerMokiTradeGotItemTextMessageProvider:
Oh, hello! That is a very nice #hat# you have.
May I have it? The sunlight in\nthese #Glades# is too bright for me.
I will give you this #empty lantern#\nfor it. My days in the dark are over.
Now begins my days in the shade.

mokiBaurRumorCompleteTextMessageProvider:
#Baur# is awake!
Is it true he remembers everything for everyone?\nThere are some days I would like to remember.
But other days...I would like to forget them.\nI will not visit him right now.

mokiBaurRumorIntroTextMessageProvider:
Have you heard of the great #Baur#?
He is a powerful guardian, but he is always asleep.
You can see him, if you head\nnorth right before the #Wellspring#.

mokiBaurRumorRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Maybe guardians hibernate?\nMaybe that is why #Baur# sleeps.
I tried to hibernate once,\nand my friend #tickled# me with a #feather#.
It is hard to laugh and sleep at the same time.

mokiLagoonRumorCompleteTextMessageProvider:
I heard a big tentacle monster was\nblocking the big wheel and you defeated it!
That is funny. So funny.
How could a little spirit fight a\nbig tentacle monster? You could not.

mokiLagoonRumorIntroTextMessageProvider:
I wander sometimes. Once, I went\nto the #Luma Pools#. It is very pretty.
There is a big wheel past the\n#Wellspring#, with a nice view from the top.
If you go #west# from the #top# of the #wheel#, you will reach the #Luma Pools#.

mokiLagoonRumorRetalkTextMessageProvider:
I have not gone to #Luma Pools# for a long time.\nThe big wheel is not moving.
I would swim down to see what is\nstopping it, but wet fur gives me sniffles.

mokiMouldwoodRumorCompleteTextMessageProvider:
I met a spider! They are\nnot scary. Not at all!
I feel bad for thinking they were scary.
They climb walls too! It is amazing.

mokiMouldwoodRumorIntroTextMessageProvider:
Are you afraid of spiders? I have never\nseen one, but I would be very afraid if I did.
I hear there are many spiders in the #Mouldwood Depths#.
It is good that a #guardian of stone# keeps them trapped inside.

mokiMouldwoodRumorRetalkTextMessageProvider:
I hear #Mouldwood Depths# is dark.\nDark like night.
I am not afraid of the dark.\nI am afraid of spiders.

spiderlingHubATextMessageProvider:
This part of the #Glades# feels most like home.

npc1TreeKeeperRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Are you lost, spirit?\nThose lost here are rarely found.

npc1TreeKeeperTalkTextMessageProvider:
You shine bright, #spirit#.\nYou disturb the silence.
Folly. #She# hears, #she# sees.\nAnd you, yes, you are easily seen.
We obey the silence. Those who\ndo not, ah! They never leave.

npc2TreeKeeperRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Turn back, spirit. While you still can.

npc2TreeKeeperTalkTextMessageProvider:
The silence, yes, whispered of you.
Ah! So brave, to walk so freely in #her# woods.
Have you seen the stones?\nCold statues of travelers past.
They stand as testament, yes, to bravery.

treeKeeperFirstEncounterRetalkTextMessageProvider:
Listen! Can you hear my last,\nyes, last tree sigh in the wind?
Without a #healer#, ah!\nI fear her voice will soon be lost.
Please go. Let me mourn, yes,\nmy garden in peace.

treeKeeperFirstEncounterTextMessageProvider:
Ah! Light-bearer. Your kind is not\nwelcome, here, in my garden.
When the trees needed you\nmost, yes, you were gone.
Now look, look!\nMy garden is all but dead, see?\nCold stone, bitter dust.
Only one tree lingers. Ah!\nEven she is not whole.
Leave this dying place, yes, as your\nkind did before. Unless you can\nbring my last daughter healing.
Bear her #poisoned limb#, light-bearer. Find a #healer of nature#.\nRight what your kind has wronged.

treeKeeperHubTextMessageProvider:
Your kind left, and my trees fell\nslowly, one by one, to the #Decay#.
But you returned and found, yes, a home.\nAh! Safe soil for the #last seed#! 
Perhaps there is hope, yet, for new life.\nPerhaps the #last seed# will become the #first tree#.

Under bright moons, I kept countless trees,\nhere, and watched them grow. Now nights are\ndark, and I am keeper of none.
All that remains is this. My last,\nyes, tree's #only seed#. I cannot watch\nthe #Decay# take it, too.
You, who returned. Take it as thanks\nfor your help. Even if it came too late.

tuleyIntroWellspringRetalkTextMessageProvider:
You ever dream of home? Sometimes\nI wake up thinking I never left.
Cozy little hut, it was. Shelves and cupboards\njust brimming with #seeds# for planting.
I tried saving them all when the blizzard came...\nI hope I didn’t #leave any behind#.

tuleyIntroWellspringSeedFoundTextMessageProvider:
I hoped you’d like my hut. Just imagine\nwhat it was like before the ice covered--\nwait, is that a #seed#?
A #Spring Plant# seed? Left to freeze in that\ncold, empty place? And still, it clings to life!
Isn’t it amazing, the strength, the\nstubbornness of such a small seed?

tuleyIntroWellspringTextMessageProvider:
I’ve seen many a novelty since I fled my\nfrozen garden after the storms. But a #spirit#...
My family told me stories. That your kind once\nroamed these lands where they call me stranger.
I’m not complaining, mind you. I’d almost\nforgotten the feeling of soft soil at my fingertips.
But it does not yet feel like home.

tuleyIntroWellspringWithSeedRetalkTextMessageProvider:
My kind, we aren’t adventurers. If it weren’t\nfor the frost, I’d never have left my old hut.
I’d never have seen the #Wellspring#, or\n#Kwolok’s Hollow#. And the seeds I found there!
Who knows how many more lay scattered,\nwaiting to be planted in these quiet #Glades#.

tuleyIntroWellspringWithSeedTextMessageProvider:
A #Spring Plant# seed! I thought I saved them\nall from that icy wasteland I once called home...
But I must have dropped one while fleeing the\nfrost. Thank you, spirit, for saving it.
My family told me stories. That your kind once\nprotected these lands where they call me stranger.
It seems the stories were true. Welcome back, spirit.\nMay we both once again feel at home.

tuleyPlantingCompleteTextMessageProvider:
These #Glades# sheltered me after I had\nto abandon my old garden to the ice.
But that garden was small and secluded.\nNo one could enjoy its beauty but me.
Now the #Glades# shelter a new garden for all,\nand I...I finally feel at home. Thank you, spirit.

tuleyGotBranchTextMessageProvider:
This branch...you must take\nit far away from here.
Can’t you see? It’s more stone than wood.\nThe tree it belonged to is beyond hope.
And it spreads quickly. I once burned\nhalf my flowerbed to kill the creeping stone.
Take it, before the new\nlife here is corrupted too.
